# VCTF4

VCTF4 is short for *Vehicle Capture the Flag - 4 Teams* and is an additional game mode for Unreal Tournament 2004.

Based on [CTF4](http://ctf4.apartment167.com/), VCTF4 extends the VCTF gameplay experience by adding two additional teams - green and gold! You will now have to defeat 3 opponent teams in order to win the game, and that can result in quite some havoc!

In CTF4, you have to capture the flag of each opponent team a certain number of times - you're not getting away by defeating the weakest team only. As one can imagine, this will not only result in fights defending your own flag - but even in fights between two teams for another team's flag. The fact that you can carry multiple flags at the same time can lead you to quicker victories - but it doesn't exactly make your life easier with two defending teams behind you! Now, as if all that wasn't enough, vehicles are added to the mix!

## Compiling

Compile this like any UT2004 package. It's called `OLTeamVehicleGames` to follow the naming scheme of `OLTeamGames` (CTF4), which is required both to compile and run VCTF4.
